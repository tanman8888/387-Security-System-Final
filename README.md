# 387-Security-System-Final

The purpose of this project was to notify the owner of an apartment at the top of some steps when there is a guest knocking at the door. This is an issue in my apartment in particular because my door is at the bottom of 20 steps, so I can never hear when someone is at the door. The original idea was to simply create a system to detect a knock and relay it up the stairs. Then I thought it would be cool create a knock password. Once I got this working, I thought it would be cool to create a different passcode with something entirely new. I found a capacative touch breakout, which simply detected when one of the pins was touched. I thought it would be cool to connect these leads to different metal parts on the door, so that the guest could enter a touch password more descretly to enter and not disturbe me. Obviously this passcode would only go out to a certain few, but I though it was a cool idea. I have a video in the wiki demonstrating that the pins can actually be connected to other metal objects and it can still detect a touch. In order to add functionallity to the project, I integrated a simple tilt sensor to detect if the doorknob was turned without either of the passcodes being entered correctly. Atthis point I was left with a simple, but unique security system. I describe the project more in depth in the wiki.
